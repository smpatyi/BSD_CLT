# Bioscape Digital Common Lab Tests

### Description:
This table was created in HTML, with the data stored in json files. The formatting was done with CSS.
The reason the data is stored in json files is so that it can be easily and quickly edited and swapped out for different data.
The information stored in the table is about common lab tests that can occur in hospitals.
This project was my first introduction to HTML and CSS, plus more advanced features in JavaScript. This was created in early May 2019.

### Running the table:
For local development and testing, XAMPP was used. XAMPP uses Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl in order to create a suitable environment locally.
XAMPP has instructions on how to install, as well as on how to run projects on its website.

### Difficulties:
Prior to this project, I had only had experience of JavaScript through Khan Academy. I had had zero experience with HTML or CSS.
Therefore, it was rather difficult to figure out how to make any of the code work in order to achieve the ideal outcome.
I was exposed to many new languages and features of said languages that I had never before encountered.
